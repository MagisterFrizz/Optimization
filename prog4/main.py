# How does the choice of [a,b] affect convergence?

# To "bracket" root first condition is to have opposite signs for f(a) and f(b)
# to ensure that interval values crosses x axis
# The larger interval -> the more iterations spent to zoom in on the root.
# The number of iterations can be computed by formula log2((b-a)/tolerance)
# If f(a) * f(b) >= 0 it means that y values has same sign,
# therefore there might be no root in the interval or hereâ€™s an even number of roots in the interval,
# and the method might fail to detect one.
